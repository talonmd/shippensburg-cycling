            <p>USA Cycling (USAC) is the governing body of amateur and professional cycling in the United States. Most races (but not all) are sanctioned by USAC. This has
                    benefits for promoters, like a set of standardized rules, access to trained professional referees to manage the race and enforce rules, and event insurance through USAC. USAC sanctioned events generally attract more riders too, because only by riding USAC sanctioned events can riders earn upgrade points.</p>

                <p>All collegiate racing is USAC sanctioned.  (Cycling is not a NCAA sport.)</p>
                <p>To race in USAC sanctioned events you have to have a USAC license. And for this there are several options.</p>
                <p>One option is to buy a collegiate license only. This will allow you to race collegiate events (road, mountain, cross, and track), but will NOT get you into any non-collegiate events. This costs $30. (Be sure to choose "Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania" as your club affiliation.)</p>
                <p>But if you're going to race collegiate events, you'll probably want to race non-collegiate events as well. There are two types of non-collegiate licenses, based on discipline. If you're already buying a collegiate license, a road license add-on, which allows you to race road, cyclocross, and track, is $30. A mountain add-on, which allows you to race mountain and cyclocross events, is also $30. If you're going to race everything, it costs $90.  (Note that most of the mountain bike racing in the mid-Atlantic area is NOT USAC sanctioned, like all the races in the <a href="http://www.masuperseries.com/" target="_blank">Mid-Atlantic Super Series</a> and <a href="http://www.racemichaux.com/" target="_blank">Michaux Endurance Series.</a>  So even if you're a big mountain biker, I'd hold off on the mountain license unless you're sure you're racing some USAC sanctioned events.)</p>

                <p>If you want to race non-collegiate events only, or you're not a student and are therefore ineligible to race in collegiate events, you'll want to buy a license based on your discipline. A road license (road, cross, track) costs $60. However, a mountain license (mountain, cross) also costs $60. If you buy both you only have to pay $90.</p>
                <p>Your final option for licensing is to buy a one-day license for the event at which you plan to race. One-day licenses are only available for beginner category riders. The cost is $10. So, if you plan to race just once (or twice), this is the right option.</p>
                <p>All this (except one-day licenses) is done online at <a href="http://usacycling.org/" target="_blank">usacycling.org.</a> </p>
                <p>Once you've paid everything then your license is mailed to you.  Along with a few cute USAC window stickers.  Or, if you're licensing the day before a race and there won't be time for your license to come in the mail, you can print an "authorization to ride" from your "My USA Cycling" page on usacycling.org.  This also works if you've lost your license, or you're in Pittsburgh or something and just realized you left your license at home.</p>
