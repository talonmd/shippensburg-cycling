            <h2 id="winter">How to Dress for Winter Riding</h2>
            <h4>What I do to stay warm during the winter</h4>

            <p>The other day I got a note from a friend asking how I keep my package warm when it gets cold--bibs and
                tights, just tights, two pairs of tights? I figured I'd share my response, along with some other
                cold-weather riding tips and just what-I-do sorts of things.</p>
            <p>Everyone has to figure out what works for them, which is to say there won't be a universal right way to
                stay warm, but I think it's helpful to learn what those who have ridden through more than a few winters
                have learned.</p>

            <p>...</p>

            <h4>On keeping male genitalia warm when cold-weather riding...</h4>

            <p>To start, I don’t have any padded tights. I always wear bib shorts under everything. When it’s cold
                enough to warrant, I pull on a pair of tights over them. Except that I cut all my tights off mid-shin,
                so I guess that makes them knickers.</p>
            <p>I have two pair of knickers—one that’s not that warm, which I wear when it’s about 35-45 degrees out, and
                another that I wear when it’s colder. If it’s REALLY cold, like less than 25 degrees, I wear a modified
                pair of hiking pants over whatever else.</p>
            <p>When it gets to freezing or below, I don’t leave home without my anatomically trimmed patch of fleece. I
                cut it from some old fabric I had lying around and, when it’s cold, I just stuff it down my shorts,
                wrapping my package in the warm, soft, comfy texture of 200 weight fleece.</p>
            <p>It’s really the best solution I’ve found. My genitals never get cold when I have that thing in place.
            </p>
            <p>There are other possible solutions. Craft makes a brief with a WindStopper patch on the front that you
                supposedly wear under everything. I think that would work ok, but I don’t like wearing underwear under
                my shorts in the winter not so much because of discomfort (though that's a concern), but because the
                extra fabric makes my butt all sweaty. And sweat, when it’s cold, should be avoided when possible. So if
                the fleece patch doesn’t appeal to you, I’d consider taking a look at the Craft brief. (Craft makes
                super stellar winter wear. IMO, Craft, Icebreaker, and maybe Patagonia are THE top-of-the-line in
                respect to cold-weather athletic wear.)</p>
            <h4>On keeping legs warm when cold-weather riding...</h4>
            <p>I'm a dedicated knee-warmer fan. Such a great piece of cold weather gear. If it's under 65 and cloudy,
                I've probably got my knee-warmers on. If it's under 60, they're on. When it’s cold enough to put my
                knickers on, it’s over the knee warmers. And I have several pair—those that are just lycra, and others
                that are fleece-lined.</p>
            <p>As I said above, I always wear a pair of bib shorts under everything. When it gets down to about 45, I
                pull my lightweight knickers on over my bibs and thin knee warmers. When it gets cold enough that I want
                my shins covered (35 degrees or so), I wear tall socks.</p>
            <p>My leg-covering strategy by approximate temperature ranges:</p>
            <p><em>55-65: bibs + thin knee-warmers<br>

                    48-55: bibs + fleece-lined knee-warmers<br>

                    38-48: bibs + thin knee-warmers + thin knickers<br>

                    20-35: bibs + thin knee-warmers (sometimes fleece-lined warmers) + warm knickers + tall socks<br>

                    under 32: everything else + fleece genital cozy<br>

                    under 20: everything else + specially modified hiking pants</em></p>

            <h4>On keeping feet warm when cold-weather riding...</h4>



            <p>Shoe covers are of course critical when the temperature drops down into the 40s. Sometimes they also make
                sense even when it's a bit warmer. Nice neoprene numbers are the best because they're waterproof.</p>
            <p>However, the single best cold-weather gear purchase I’ve made in the past five years are my winter riding
                shoes. I have the <a
                    href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=shimano+winter+cycling+shoes#q=shimano+winter+cycling+shoes&hl=en&prmd=ivs&source=univ&tbs=shop:1&tbo=u&ei=dpziTM24KML6lwfy-rGpAw&sa=X&oi=product_result_group&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQzAMwAA&biw=1190&bih=939&fp=fbb9e82777227709" target="_blank">Shimano
                    MW80s.</a> Such. A. Good. Idea.</p>
            <p>I got mtb (as opposed to road) winter shoes because they’re much more versatile. They work well when
                mountain biking, obviously, but if I want to wear them on my road bike I just move my pedals over. Mine
                are a size bigger than my usual riding shoe size so I can wear a thicker sock and still have a little
                room in there. A too-tight shoe makes for blood circulation problems which accentuates cold-weather
                feet-warming issues.</p>
            <p>If it’s really cold (less than 25 degrees), and I’m going to be out for more than two hours, I’ll put
                shoe covers over them. But really, I’ve found the problem with keeping feet warm on a bike in the really
                cold is the negative heat transfer from your cold metal crank and pedal to the sole of your shoe. Shoe
                covers do nothing to solve that issue. So if my feet get cold in 20 degree weather I find I just need to
                get off and walk a few minutes and they’ll warm right back up. This is of course easier in mtb shoes
                than in road shoes.</p>

            <h4>On keeping the torso warm when cold-weather riding...</h4>

            <p>Keeping your torso warm is a good deal about managing sweat and wind. I've found that when heading out
                for a long winter ride I'm going to sweat a lot more in the first, say, 60-90 minutes than I am the rest
                of the ride. So I like to bring along a spare base layer. After 90 minutes or so I strip off my sweaty
                wet one and put on the fresh dry one. Or just take the sweaty base layer off and then put everything
                else back on. Makes all the difference in the world.</p>
            <p>Bulking up with extra layers is less important than making sure you've got a good wind shield in the
                front. So a good wind vest with rear ventilation is critical.</p>
            <p>I've found that with our new (last year) Shippensburg jackets that it's so warm I don't want to put it on
                until the temperature drops well below 40 degrees, and then with just a base layer under. But I always
                bring along a vest, and if I get cold later, I either swap out base layers (for a dry one) or put on my
                vest under the jacket, or both. I can go a long way in 30 degree weather using this strategy.</p>

            <h4>On keeping your head warm during cold-weather riding...</h4>
            <p>When it gets down to 50 or so I like to throw on a thin hat or ear-covering thing (actually, I used to do
                the ear-covering thing, but now I only do hats). I have low tolerance for cold ears, so I keep them
                covered.</p>
            <p>When it gets below freezing, you might benefit from wearing a balaclava. I find, however, that keeping a
                nice full beard does the job and balaclavas often leave me over-heated.</p>
            <p>When it’s under 30 degrees I usually wear ski goggles right over my helmet. This works surprisingly well.
                I've found goggles make an amazing difference in keeping your entire face/head warm. A skullcap +
                goggles keeps my head much more comfortable than a balaclava + sunglasses, but I generally pack along an
                extra balaclava when it's cold just in case. Goggles + balaclava makes your head virtually impenetrable
                to cold, which I've found advantageous when it's cold, the wind is blowing, and, if that wasn't enough,
                it starts to snow.</p>

            <h4>On keeping your hands warm during cold-weather riding...</h4>
            <p>This one is easy: wear gloves.</p>
            <p>Really, it's that easy. If your hands are cold your gloves aren't thick enough. Ski gloves work best.</p>
            <p>I've also found leather work gloves to work really, really well until about 32 degrees. And leather work
                gloves are an awful lot more economical than fancy full-fingered winter cycling gloves.</p>
            <p>Now, if your hands do get cold when you're out riding, it helps to windmill your arms several times
                really fast to push the blood out to your finger tips. When people first see this trick they're
                generally skeptical, but then they try it and they believe. Trust me, it works.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>Well, I think that about covers it. Have your own cold-weather riding tip? Post away if you're not
                afraid...</p>
